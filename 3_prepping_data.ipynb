       "\"On XX/XX/2019, I used WorldRemit to send money internationally to XXXX WorldRemit 's website was seemingly very clear about all of the fees involved. The transaction went smoothly. However, when I received my credit card bill from XXXX ( statement for billing period XX/XX/19-XX/XX/19 ), I found I was charged a large fee for making a cash advance. \\n\\nWhen I made the transaction on WorldRemit, there was nothing to indicate that the transaction would be treated as a cash advance. I called XXXX to complain, and they told me that they had no control over the fee -- that the merchant ( WorldRemit ) submitted the transaction as a cash advance. I called WorldRemit to complain, and they told me that they had no control over the way in which the bank processed the transaction -- that they did not submit it as a cash advance, but that XXXX chose to process it as a cash advance. \\n\\nSince neither company accepts responsibility for the additional fee, I am considering both to be committing fraud.\""
